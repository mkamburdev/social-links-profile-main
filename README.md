## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

While working on this SCSS project, I gained practical experience in fundamental SCSS concepts. I learned to use variables to control values such as colors and fonts from a centralized location. Additionally, I practiced responsive design using media queries and modern layout techniques like flexbox. By modularizing the project files, I learned to create a more modular structure and improve code management for larger-scale projects.
